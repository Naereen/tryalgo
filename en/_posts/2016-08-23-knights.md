Accessibility in a grid consisting of cells with heights and water flooding.

## A graph model

Consider the graph consisting of grid cells containing no water and there is an edge between two cells if the difference in coordinates is respectively N and M.

The goal is to compute the connected component containing the cell (0,0).  In this component count the number of odd and the number of even degree vertices.  A simple DFS exploration can solve the problem.
