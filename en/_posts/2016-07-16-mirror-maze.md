Given a grid with two openings and two sided mirrors in some grid cells, find an orientation for the mirrors at 45 or -45 degrees, such that a laser beam entering one opening would be reflected all the way to the second opening.

## An \\( O(n^2) \\) algorithm

We use the following graph representation for this problem.  Every mirror *a* generates up to 4 vertices, one for each direction *up, left, down, right*.  If some mirror *b* is reachable from *a* in direction *d* then there is a vertex *(a,d)* and by symmetry a vertex *(b,inv(d))* --- where the *inv* function inverts the direction --- and these vertices are connected by an edge. In addition vertices *(a,d)* and *(a,e)* are connected by an edge if *d* and *e* are adjacent directions.  This construction is completed with a vertex for each of two openings. Each opening vertex is connected to the reachable mirror (if any).  The opening vertices are connected together by an edge, or --- variant of the graph model --- connected each to an additional vertex.  We distinguish two kind of edges: (i) horizontal or vertical ones and (ii) diagonal or anti-diagonal ones.

We claim that the graph has a perfect matching if and only if the mirror maze instance has a solution.  The interpretation of a matching is the following.  A vertical or horizontal edge in the matching means that the laser does not follow this trajectory.  A diagonal or anti diagonal edge in the matching, say *((a,d),(a,e))*, means that the laser reflects on the mirror *a* without however distinguishing the case that the laser enters *a* from direction *d* and leaves in direction *e* or the opposite case.  Note that if there are two reflections happening on a mirror then these are not conflicting and there is a unique corresponding mirror position.


The algorithm consists of

- building the graph model,
- creating a near perfect matching, consisting of all horizontal and vertical edges. This corresponds to the complete absence of the laser beam.
- tries to build a perfect matching, by searching for a single alternating augmenting path,

This last step is hard to implement as it needs [Edmond's blossom algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blossom_algorithm).

## Example

## Note

The mirror maze problem can be solved with backtracking.  Such a solution is of course not running in polynomial time in the worst case, but seems to pass all the tests and is quite easy to implement.  But such a solution is cheating, wouldn't you agree ?


## References

Most available implementations of Edmond's blossom algorithm are a bit long (who can blame?), but the following by David Eppstein is quite elegant:
