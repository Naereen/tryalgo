Some typos we spotted in the book.

- page 40 Figure 1.8: there should be two different gray shades among the rectangles. In the final print they might be too close to be distinguished.

- page 55: In the code of *powerstring_by_find*,  the variables *u* and *x* should be the same.

- page 240, last line: suffix of t begn inning -> beginning
